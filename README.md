*Meharry Medical College, School of Applied Computational Sciences, Department of Computer Science and Data Science*

**Instructor:** Dr. Graham West  
**Email:** gwest791@mmc.edu  
**Term:** Spring 2025

## Course Overview
This course offers a comprehensive introduction to advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, focusing on real-world applications and practical skills. Students will develop programming skills fundamental to data science (DS) and machine learning (ML), including tools like GitHub, Conda, and CRISP-DM methodology. The course covers a wide range of data types (text, time series, images) and specialized models to handle each type.

## Key Areas Covered:
- **Fundamentals:**
  - Python environments (pip, conda)
  - Github
  - CRISP-DM
- **EDA and ML:**
  - Pandas
  - sklearn
  - Keras
- **Unstructured text processing:**
  - Regex
  - Web scraping
- **Time Series data:**
  - Markov chains
  - Forecasting
  - Seasonal trend analysis
  - Mean-variance optimization
  - LSTM's
- **Image classification:**
  - CNN's
  - Transfer learning pretrained models
