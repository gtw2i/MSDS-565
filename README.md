# Predictive Modeling and Analytics (MSDS 565-01)
*Meharry Medical College, School of Applied Computational Sciences, Department of Computer Science and Data Science*

**Instructor:** Dr. Graham West  
**Email:** gwest791@mmc.edu  
**Term:** Spring 2025

## Course Overview
This course offers a comprehensive introduction to advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, focusing on real-world applications and practical skills. Students will develop programming skills fundamental to data science (DS) and machine learning (ML), including tools like GitHub, Conda, and CRISP-DM methodology. The course covers a wide range of data types (text, time series, images) and specialized models to handle each type.

## Key Areas Covered:
- **Fundamentals:**
  - Python environments (pip, conda)
  - Github
  - CRISP-DM
- **EDA and ML:**
  - Pandas
  - sklearn
  - Keras
- **Types of Data:**
  - Text: regex, web scraping
  - Time Series: Markov chains, forecasting, seasonal trend analysis, mean-variance optimization, LSTM's
  - Images: Transfer learning pretrained CNN's w/ Keras

### Note on Datasets
Since the datasets are too large for Github file limits, please find the datasets in our Blackboard course shell.
